This is automation for closing all the windows from all the workspaces, I have created this because I was too lazy to do that lol

# Requirements:

`sudo apt install wmctrl`

# Automation:

Add this to you bashrc/zshrc file:
`alias whateverName='cd to/the/folder/of/windowsAuto && node automation.js`
